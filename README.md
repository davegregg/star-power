## ðŸŒŸ Star Power ðŸŒŸ
**Star Power is a Slack bot built for my technical school, Kenzie Academy.**
Star Power brings together your community and encourages praise - because that's always nice. 
## How to use
In Star Power's dedicated shoutout channel users can give praise to whomever they want to by @ing thing and including :star-power: anywhere in the message.

> Shoutout to @JohnAnderson for building this bot! :star-power:

> Big thanks to @KenzieAcademy for teaching me how to code, have some stars! :star-power: :star-power:

> @Adam @Joe @Zach You guys are the best! :star-power: :star-power: :star-power:

*You can mention multiple people and split the stars evenly among them! So each mentioned person in this example would get 1 star*

Users can also react on any message with :star-power: to give a freebie star to the poster!
