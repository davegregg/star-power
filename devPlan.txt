Commands:
!help - Display this help message
!stars - Show how many stars you have in your account
!leaderboard - Display the people with the top 5 stars and the top 5 star-power philanthropists

Adding users to DB:
1. On any message/reply in thread check if user is in DB. If not, add them and give 2 stars.

General flow:
1. User sends a message that includes :star-power:
2. Bot receives message and checks:
    - How many users were mentioned (@)
    - How many stars were sent
    - If sender has that many stars (bail out if not)
    - If usersMentioned > 1 check that the amount of stars sent % usersMentioned == 0 to split evenly (bail out if not)

3a. If sender doesn't have enough send a failure message to channel (Or DM them)
3b. If sender has enough then take away starsSent from sender and add starsSent to user(s)

handleTransaction:
1. For loop through receiver array, make sure each one is a user.
2. Check how many receivers. if one, then take away starsSent from sender and give starsSent to receiver

IDEAS:
- Track amountReceived to track how many shoutouts people get
- !user {@user} to see that users info
